Signs are set up at Steamboat Ski Area warning skiers about snowmaking operations and cautioning them about potential dangers of making the trek up the mountain for a few early season turns. Citing an effort to promote skier safety, ski area officials are asking those uphill upstarts to read through a list of dangers and don a free reflective armband made available by the ski area.
