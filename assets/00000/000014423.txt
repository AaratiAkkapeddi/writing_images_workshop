"""""""The chief honors of the evening were disputed between Ella (Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna) and Princess Zenaide Yusupov. My heart ached a bit at the sight of these two 'mad devotions' of my early life. I danced every dance with Princess Yusupov, until it came to the famous 'Russkaya.' She did it better than any ballerina, but I limited my participation to hand-clapping and silent admiration."""" -Grand Duke Alexander in 'Once a Grand Duke'"""
