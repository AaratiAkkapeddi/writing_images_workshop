<h1>Writing Images: Exploring the data behind popular text to image generation models</h1><br>
This workshop provides a brief introduction to the data and technical processes behind popular text to image models through a combination of lecture and group activity. Specifically, we will focus on Stable Diffusion and take a ‘tour’ of the dataset behind it, LAION 5b - one of the largest text & image datasets. We will walk through the creation of LAION 5b, making pit-stops along the way to unpack technical terms and discuss potential ethical questions that arise.
