<a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/">LAION-5B</a> contains over 5 billion image-text pairs. I have downloaded a small subset of their <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-aesthetics/">'aesthetically pleasing' subset</a>. To produce an aesthetic score, LAION creators used a model they trained on the <a href="https://github.com/JD-P/simulacra-aesthetic-captions">Simulcra Aesthetic Captions</a> dataset, a dataset of AI generated images & their prompts that users rated on a scale of 1-10.
The images that I downloaded also have similarity scores (from the CLIP filtering) and "unsafe" scores. The Unsafe Score comes from yet <a href="https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector"><em>another</em> AI model</a> trained to detect "NSFW" images. The automation of NSFW ratings is something that my friend Livia Foldes has been thinking a lot about in relation to sex workers rights with her group <a href="https://decodingstigma.tech/">Decoding Stigma</a>. As you can imagine, there is a lot of problems with automatic detection of NSWF images from the use of nonconsensual imagery in training data to false positives.
<br><br>
But let's take a look at this subset that I've downloaded in order of the NSFW/unsafe score... <br>

<br>
Of course, aesthetic is also an interesting thing to try to quantify...

Spend some time exploring this subset. For reference, I have downloaded 1454 images which is only about 0.00002908% of the full dataset.
